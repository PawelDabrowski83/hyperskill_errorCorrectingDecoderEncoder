Stage 1/5: Symbol-level error emulator 
<p>In this stage, you should write a program that creates errors in the input text, 1 random error per 3 symbols. An error means that the character is replaced by another random character. For example, “abc” characters can be “*bc” or “a*c” or “ab*”, where * is a random character. You can replace by any character but recommended to use only uppercase and lowercase English letters, spacebar and numbers.</p>
